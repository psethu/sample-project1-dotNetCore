# App-DotNetCore

This project was created with .Net Core 3.1 using Visual Studio 2019

## Development server

1. Open Visual Studio and run the application by selecting IIS Express.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/taxirides`. The app will present some default values using  TaxiRideModel.cs

## Note  
1. TaxiRideModel.cs and TaxiFareModel.cs are the main models of the application
2. Ultimately, goal is to start angular app as client and start this repoâ€™s project as server. Then from angular app, we can access the endpoints on the dotNetCore side. However, despite some workarounds, the CORS notice still appears in Chrome/Microsoft Edge.

## Future
1. Resolve CORS issue to communicate between the Angular clent side and Dotnet server side
2. Database connectivity
3. Add complete CRUD http endpoints -- create, read, update, delete.
4. Authentication/authorization
5. Load balancing. To make system more fault tolerant when there is a huge amount of accesses in short period
